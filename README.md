# Duplicate Sweep

**Duplicate Sweep** is my very first project, and I wanted to create a tool to clean and organize photo libraries. I came up with a creative name, "Photo Sweep," but later decided to change it to "Duplicate Sweep." So, if you run the executable, don’t be confused by the name—it’s still **Duplicate Sweep** in spirit!

Duplicate Sweep is a Python-based tool designed to help you clean and organize your photo library. With this tool, you can remove duplicate images, filter photos based on size, date, and other criteria. The tool is lightweight, efficient, and easy to use on any system that supports Python.
